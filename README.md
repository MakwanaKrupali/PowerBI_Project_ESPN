## Problem Statement ## 
In this particular project we have used web as the data source.
We basically have imported the data for India, South Africa for three different categories that is
batting, bowling and fielding.
We have basically provided the user with the flexibility to choose for any certain player, and then
he or she will get all the following details that you can see on the screen through these power BI report
pages.
So the first page is related to batting data analysis.
Second one is related to bowling data analysis and third one is related to fielding data analysis.
There was some tabular data which was basically being represented, 
the ESPN Cricinfo page.
